This plugin provides simple-to-use submit rules, hence the name.

## Features
- REST API to configure the options and labels.
- Ability to prevent submission if there are unresolved comments.
- Ability to require approval, and to consider approval from the change author or not.
- (soon!) a simple PolyGerrit UI to configure the labels and how they work.

### Inheritance
This plugin supports configuration inheritance, following a worst case scenario when
this is possible> That is, children projects can't use weaker options that their
parents.

The REST API provides a view of the configuration including inheritance.
The PUT method only changes the current project's configuration.

The Copy Scores are handled by Core Gerrit.

## The REST API
This plugin exposes a REST API to configure the labels and simple rules. It is available via the
following endpoints:

Anonymously: `@URL@projects/ProjectName/simple-submit-rules`

Authenticated: `@URL@a/projects/ProjectName/simple-submit-rules`

The authenticated endpoint uses the default Gerrit authentication and permissions systems.

The `READ_CONFIG` permission is required to access the configuration.

The `WRITE_CONFIG` permission is required to make changes to the configuration.

The project name in the URI must be urlencoded if it contains special characters like a slash.
This follows the current conventions used in Gerrit.

This endpoint is available using two HTTP methods: `GET` and `PUT`.

The GET request serves a JSON response with the current settings. The scheme used in this
response is the same used for the PUT request body, so it will only be described once.

## Schema

```
{
  "comments": CommentsRules,
  "labels": {
    "Verified": LabelDefinition,
    "Code-Review": LabelDefinition
  }
}
```

The comments section defines the rules to apply to comments (can the change be submitted with
unresolved comments, â€¦). The labels section defines each label.

It is reasonable to consider that a label missing from the labels section won't be reset,
but consumers should not rely upon it.

### CommentsRules

```
{
  "block-if-unresolved-comments": boolean
}
```

When block-if-unresolved-comments is set to true, a Change with unresolved comments
CAN'T be submitted.

### LabelDefinition

```
{
  "function": LabelFunction,
  "ignore-self-approval": boolean,
  "copy-scores": CopyScoreRule[]
}
```

The LabelFunction specifies the behavior to use for this label.
It allows marking a label as mandatory, and defines if negative votes are blocking or not.
The list of functions is defined under.

When ignore-self-approval is set, the change author can't approve his own change.

The copy-scores list defines under what circumstances the votes (for this specific label)
should be kept. The list of rules is defined below.


### CopyScoreRule
CopyScoreRule value is an enum value, encoded as a string.

Each rule defines a behavior when a change is updated.

The possible options are: `copy-min-score`, `copy-max-score`, `copy-all-scores-if-no-change`
`copy-all-scores-if-no-code-change`, `copy-all-scores-on-merge-commit-first-parent-update`, and
`copy-all-scores-on-trivial-rebase`

See the Labels documentation page for more information.

### LabelFunction
The LabelFunction is an enum value, encoded as a string.

Example: `MaxWithBlock`, `AnyWithBlock`...

See the Labels documentation page for more information.
