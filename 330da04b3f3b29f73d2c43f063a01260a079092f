      "message": "Core Gerrit doesn\u0027t do well with per-label configs it doesn\u0027t know about. There are cases where it will just overwrite them. Therefore I stored this in the plugins configuration where that can\u0027t happen. I\u0027ll update the commit message.\n\nIt is not exactly optimal though, as the config might get orphaned if the label gets renamed in core. The alternative would be to make sure that core never overwrites label configs and keeps \u0027unknown\u0027 settings in place. This seems not too hard to do for now, but very hard to enforce going forward).\n\nHaving this config be orphaned in that case is annoying, but doesn\u0027t seem like a deal breaker to me.\n\nDo you have a better suggestion?",
